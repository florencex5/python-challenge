# Python-Challenge
Used Python to finish the following two tasks (PyBank & PyPoll) and present the final analysis results into text files


## PyBank
Used for loop to calculate the following values:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
